### Abstract

Data from the 2020 Formula 1 racing season was downloaded from ergast.com, the official
 API of F1, containing results from the 17 race season. The information returned 
 from the API call is messy, hard to interpret, and deeply nested. To make the
results more interpretable a dplyr data cleaning pipeline was implemented
to flatten the table structure with only necessary fields.

To enhance a viewers ability to interpret the tabular results two graphics were
built to show driver and constructor performance over the season. The driver
graphic clearly shows the dominance of Mercedes.

### Part 1 - Data Prep

An example API call, with only one race result, and code to explain how the JSON
payload was saved to a local flat file.
```{r, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
samp_res = GET("https://ergast.com/api/f1/2020/results.json?limit=1?callback=myParser")
f1_samp = fromJSON(rawToChar(samp_res$content))
saveRDS(f1_samp, "./data/f1_samp.rds")
```

The raw structure is very nested and needs to be expanded. A full extraction was saved
locally and used for visualization called ./data/f1.rds. The nested structure can be 
seen from the R data viewer.

![](./data/f1_data_viewer.png)
</center>
<br/>
To make this format more plot friendly it needs to be cleaned. First, I manually 
identified the most "granular" nested item from the f1 object: races. To correctly
format the nested structure I converted races to a tibble and leveraged various 
dplyr functions making use of hoist to cut down on unnecessary unnest_wider calls. 
The top 10 rows were displayed using head.
```{r task1}
f1 = readRDS(file="data/f1.rds")
val = f1$MRData$RaceTable$Races
# convert to tibble
val = tibble::tibble(val)
# dplyr pipeline start
val = val %>% hoist(
  val,
  race_name = "raceName",
  round = "round",
  date = "date",
  results = "Results"
) %>% # elongate results for each race at driver level
  unnest_longer(results) %>%
  # hoist again to extract final table 
  hoist(
    results,
    givenName = c("Driver", "givenName"),
    familyName = c("Driver", "familyName"),
    name = c("Constructor", "name"),
    position = "positionText",
    points = "points"
  ) %>% # concatenate driver name
  mutate(driver = paste(givenName, familyName, sep = " "),
         position = case_when(
          position == 'R' ~ as.character(NA), #"Ret",
          position == 'D' ~ as.character(NA), #"DQ",
          position == 'E' ~ as.character(NA), #"Excluded",

          TRUE ~ position
         )) %>%

### Part 2 - Visualization

F1 is a truly unique sport combining the marvels of modern engineering
with some of the most gifted reflex-based athletes in the world. Many
people might not be aware of the resource disparities which exist between teams
who compete in the same races for the same championship crown. Just how unequal are 
these teams in terms of the seasonal F1 points system awarded based on final race
position? This visualization hopes to display how F1 is dominated by the top team(s) by 
displaying the performance of drivers and teams in the 2020 F1 season. Two charts were created for this purpose:

**Spiral Team Chart (A):**<br/>
Team performance through each race is displayed using a circular bar 
plot. Race abbreviations, denoted along the outside edge, start from 1:00 and 
move clockwise around the circle in order of race occurrence. Points for each
driver are aggregated by team, cumulatively summed over the season, and shown
by color. This chart clearly shows the dominance by team Mercedes over the season
as the color largest block in each race is affiliated with this team. We see this
percentage remain relatively constant from the first few races of the season all
the way to the finale.

**Spiral Driver Chart (B):**<br/>
Point disparities amongst drivers and teams are most magnified at season end. To
show this lopsided distribution a spiral bar chart was created. Drivers are
grouped by constructor and colored according to their affiliation. From this 
chart one can observe just how dominant Lewis Hamilton (and team Mercedes) really
was. Hamilton has almost twice as many points as the next closest opposing driver.
This chart also shows the large number of drivers with 0 points, evident by the
missing axis tick marks denoting point totals.
